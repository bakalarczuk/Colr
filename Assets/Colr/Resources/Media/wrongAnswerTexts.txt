Oh! Don't worry.
OK. Next time :)
That's OK :)
It was close :)
Smile!!! :)
No worries, try again!
Almost there, keep going!
You're learning. That's what matters!
Every mistake is a step to success!
Keep trying, you're getting better!
Not quite, but you've got this!
Mistakes are proof that you're trying.
It's only a stepping stone.
Progress, not perfection!
You'll nail it next time!
A little hiccup, nothing more!
Keep pushing, you're on the right track!
Learning moment, that's all!
Courage in the attempt is all we need.
You're closer than you think.
No success without trial.
Take a breath, and try again.
Everyone stumbles, just get back up.
The effort counts most.
